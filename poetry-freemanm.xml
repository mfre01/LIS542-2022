<title>Wild Mountain Thyme</title> Lyrics 

<firstverse>Oh, the summertime is comin', 
And the trees are sweetly blooming, 
Here the wild mountain thyme 
Grows around the blooming heather </firstverse>

<firstchorus>Chorus</firstchorus> 
<actualchorus>Will ye go, lassie, will ye go? 
And we'll all go together to pick wild mountain thyme All around the blooming heather. 
Will ye go, lassie, will ye go? </actualchorus>

<secondverse>I will build my love a bower 
By yon pure crystal fountain 
And around it I will place 
All the flowers of the mountain. </secondverse>

 <repeatchorus>Chorus... </repeatchorus>

<thirdverse>If my true love e'er should leave me 
I would surely find another 
Where the wild mountain thyme 
Grows around the blooming heather. </thirdverse>

<repeatchorus>Chorus...</repeatchorus> 

<lastverse>Oh, the autumn-time is comin', 
And the leaves are gently falling, 
Where the wild mountain thyme 
Grows around the blooming heather</lastverse> 

<repeatchorus>Chorusâ€¦ </repeatchorus>
